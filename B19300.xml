            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He most Serene and most Mighty Prince and Lord, <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and the High and Mighty Lords the States General of the <hi>United Netherlands,</hi> reflecting with much grief and trouble on the miseries and calamities of the War which is lately broken out in the Borders between the two Crowns, and which spreading its flame in the Neighbourhood, if not timely prevented, will by an inevitable consequence involve the greatest part of the Princes and States of Christendom in the same evils, have thought they should be much wanting to that duty God hath injoyned them, if now that they have by his mercy so happily renewed and restored the ancient Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Alliance between <hi>Great Britain</hi> and the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Netherlands,</hi> and at the same time established a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:205632:3"/> Peace between four powerful States, who were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in that bloudy Warre, they should not employ, and with all diligence apply themselves to settle those differences that have arisen between the said two Crowns, and particularly for the quenching the flame of that Warre upon the Confines. And therefore the most Serene King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and the High and Mighty States of the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> having after much pains and great Instance, obtained from the most Christian King, a Promise to the said States General, That he will forthwith and from this time forward lay down his Arms, on condition the <hi>Spaniards</hi> be ready, formally and solemnly by a Treaty of Peace; to quit to him all those Places and Forts, together with the Chastellenyes and their Appurtenances, which he has by force of Armes taken in, or fortifi'd in the last years Expedition, or otherwise that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> be brought to transferr to him all the remainder of their Right to the <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> (or to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 word">

That the High and Mighty Lords the States General, do reciprocally undertake and secure to the most Christian King, that by reasons and other means they will prevail with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to consent to the same Conditions: They have thought, that in this season and conjuncture of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:205632:3"/> affairs, they should employ themselves very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagiously, not onely for the Interest of both the said Kings, but of all other neighbouring Princes and States, if by their joynt Counsels and endeavours they should exhort, and as much as in them lies, obliege the two before-mentioned Crowns, to make Peace upon the Articles and Conditions abovesaid: To which end, We whose Names are here subscribed, by virtue of our respective Powers, and in pursuance of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, have agreed upon these following Points and Articles.</p>
